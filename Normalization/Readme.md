The Objective of the paper is look behind the Normalization, how it helps in Generalization of model and in accelerating the speed of training a model.

Some question it answer are follows

1. What are the main motivations behind different normal-
ization methods in DNNs, and how can we present a taxonomy
for understanding the similarities and differences between a wide
variety of approaches?

2. How can we reduce the gap between the empirical success
of normalization techniques and our theoretical understanding of
them?

3. What recent advances have been made in designing/tailoring
normalization techniques for different tasks, and what are the main
insights behind them?
